# OpenCV

A [PlumCraft](https://github.com/seantrue/plumcraft) engine on OpenCV: filters, edges, thresholds, morphology and geometry as nodes. It began as `plumcraft-engine new --id opencv --name OpenCV --types array,image`.

- **Pictures are ARRAY values:** float32 0-1, H × W × 3 in RGB, or H × W for one channel, so they cross to any engine unchanged. OpenCV's BGR and 8-bit formats stay inside `src/opencv_engine/__init__.py`.
- **OpenCV is pinned** in `pyproject.toml`, and named in `dependencies` on the engine class, so an upgrade never reuses an old result.
- **Run it as a process,** as `plumcraft-engine.toml` does. A `cv2.error` is an error on that node; a crash in OpenCV's C++ can't be caught, and the host restarts the engine.


## The first five minutes

```sh
uv sync                                  # the project's environment, with the PlumCraft SDK
scripts/check                            # ruff, the tests, the golden catalogue and conformance
scripts/nodes                            # the catalogue
scripts/run --watch parsed.float   # the demo, events as they come
```

| Script | What it runs | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/check` | `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `pytest` | uv |
| `scripts/nodes` | `plumcraft-engine nodes`: the catalogue, in process | uv |
| `scripts/run [GRAPH] [--watch NODE.PORT]... [--cancel-after S] [--attach URL]` | `plumcraft-engine run`: the demo by default; exits 0 when every node is done or cached | uv |
| `scripts/serve [PORT]` | `python -m opencv_engine --listen 127.0.0.1:PORT`, 7311 by default | uv |
| `scripts/conform` | `plumcraft-engine check`: PlumCraft's conformance cases, in process and over HTTP; then `plumcraft conform`, the Rust half on a socket and over HTTP, when PlumCraft is built | uv |
| `scripts/cli-run [GRAPH] [--http]` | `plumcraft run --engine-manifest`: the same run through PlumCraft's Rust CLI | a built PlumCraft |
| `scripts/editor [GRAPH]` | `plumcraft-editor --engine-manifest`: the editor with this engine, on the demo by default | a built PlumCraft |
| `scripts/install`, `scripts/uninstall` | Link `plumcraft-engine.toml` into `~/.config/plumcraft/engines/`, so every editor offers this engine | |

## Using it in the editor

```sh
scripts/editor
```

The editor starts this engine from `plumcraft-engine.toml` and opens the demo. `scripts/_plumcraft.sh` looks for the editor in `$PLUMCRAFT_BIN`, on PATH, then in your PlumCraft checkout's `target/`; build it there with `cargo build --release -p plumcraft-cli -p plumcraft-editor`.

**The loop:** edit a node, Engine › Reconnect (a fresh process, the same graph), run.

To have every editor offer this engine, `scripts/install`, then Engine › Reload Engine List in one already running. The Engine menu lists it with two hostings, a process and HTTP. It can run beside other engines too: Engine › Add Engine.

To debug, or to reach an engine on another machine, serve it yourself and attach: `scripts/serve`, then Engine › Attach…, `http://127.0.0.1:7311`, no token.

## PyCharm

Open this folder as a project. PyCharm 2024.3 or later sees `uv.lock` (after a first `uv sync`) and offers the uv environment; with an older one, run `uv sync`, then add `.venv/bin/python` as an existing interpreter.

Run configurations, in the toolbar's list:

| Configuration | What it does |
|---|---|
| Serve (HTTP 7311) | The engine, for Engine › Attach |
| Run demo | The demo in process |
| Run demo (attached) | The demo against Serve |
| Nodes | The catalogue |
| Tests | Everything in `tests/` |
| Conformance | The conformance checks alone |
| Editor | `scripts/editor` |

**To stop at a breakpoint in a node:** debug "Serve (HTTP 7311)", attach from the editor with Engine › Attach… (or run "Run demo (attached)"), and run. The node stops at the breakpoint. The engine keeps answering while it is paused, so the editor shows the node as running; after a long pause it may report the run as failed, and the real reply replaces that when you resume. "Run demo" under Debug needs no editor at all.

`.run/`, `.idea/opencv-engine.iml` and `.idea/modules.xml` are committed. `.idea/misc.xml` names your machine's interpreter, so it isn't.

## Adding a node

Add a method to `OpencvEngine` in `src/opencv_engine/__init__.py`:

```python
@node("Reverse")
def reverse(self, text: Text) -> Text:
    """Text backwards. The docstring is the node's description."""
    return text[::-1]
```

`Text` and the other types come from `plumcraft_engine`; add the import if this file doesn't have it yet.

- **Inputs:** annotations make the ports. A plain `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool` or `Literal` is a widget that can also be wired; a wire type such as `Text` is a socket.
- **Output:** the return annotation. A `NamedTuple` gives several outputs.
- **Errors:** raise `ConfigError` for something the user can fix, `OpError` for a failure on this input.
- **A long node:** take `*, cx: Cx`, call `cx.progress(fraction, stage)`, and stop when `cx.cancelled()`.
- **A conversion ships with its inverse,** and a test in `tests/test_roundtrips.py` that goes there and back.

Then add a test in `tests/test_nodes.py`, and run `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 uv run pytest` once, because the catalogue changed. The golden file is what catches a renamed port, which would break saved workflows. If you add a node to `examples/demo.json`, the conformance check runs it too.

The PlumCraft SDK's `python/README.md` lists every annotation.

## The SDK

`pyproject.toml` takes the SDK from `[tool.uv.sources]`. A path follows the PlumCraft checkout, so the engine always runs the SDK the editor was built with; on another machine, edit the path, or use a pinned commit:

```toml
plumcraft-engine = { git = "ssh://git@github.com/seantrue/plumcraft", subdirectory = "python", rev = "<commit>" }
```
